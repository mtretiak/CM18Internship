## Work / Project Examples
### Dew.
During my time at the University of Calgary I was able to partner with a local development company, [eXDee](https://exdee.ai/dew). This was for a specialized course in iOS development. The eXDee challenged my team, a group of 7 cpsc students, to come up with new features to their mental health application 'dew.'. My team and I were able to ideate and come up with a journaling feature to add to the application. We focused our efforts on Natural Language Processing and using IBM watson technology to get the sentiment anaylsis of the journal entry. We succesfully shipped the product to the team and it will be worked into dew. in the coming months.

My Roll:
- UI/UX lead
  - During this project I took on the challenge of creating mock-ups during the ideation process to drive our brainstorm.
  - Implementing the UI in xcode for demo purposes and end use, using Swift.
- Communications lead
  - I was the head of communiation for the 7 students between eXDee and our professor, Dr. Christian Jacob.
  - This included creating and editing formal reports, email communications, and setting meetings.

### Doot.
This was a term project for CPSC 499: Software Entrepreneurship with Dr. Frank Maurer and Dr. Mea Wang. This course was designed to have an interdisciplinary approach to solving problems and creating software. We were tasked to create a team that consisted of at least 2 CPSC students and 2 Entrepreneur students. Over the weeks we were tasked to find a problem, create a solution that was software based, and implement a sudo business. This included things like marketing plans, operations plans, development planning and implementation. Our team decided to focus our efforts on creating an iOS application that catered to the growing market of food trucks in Calgary by implementing an app that would help customers locate the trucks, customers are able to purchase ahead of time, and have the trucks be able to process payment on the app as well.

My Roll:
- UI/UX lead
  - Creating multiple logo ideas
  - Drafting mock-ups for user flows
  - Prototyping UI and UX in Adobe XD
  - Implementing the UI in Xcode, using Swift.

### Technovation
Technovation is 12 Week program that offers young women around the world the opportunity to learn the skills they need to emerge as tech entrepreneurs and leaders. Many go on to study computer science, entrepreneurship, and business. During the 12 weeks, teams are formed and are tasked with creating an application that solves a real-world problem.
I am currently participating in Technovation as a Technical Mentor. As a Technical Mentor, I am tasked with teaching my team what it takes to create an app. My team has decided to take on the challenge of connecting Government Representatives with their constituents. 

My Roll:
- Technical Mentor:
  - Teaching a self-curated curriculum on Swift and Xcode
  - Assisting in creating visual mock-ups
  - Assisting in ideation
  - Teaching well-crafted product design practices
  - Communicating and planning with Business Mentor

## Inspiration
I find my inspiration from a lot of sources, let it be nature, art, professors, etc. These are three of my most recent Inspirations to create new things.

### [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com)
Awwwards is one of my go-to for inspiration and creation to see whats new. If you've never been to or used Awwwards, it is a catalog of curated and voted on best of websites. I love looking to Awwwards for inspiration because it keeps me up-to-date on whats new in web technology, what people are trying, and what other designers and users think actually looks good. It also brings you across websites that you might otherwise not stumble upon like [space goldman](http://spacegoldman.com), [the new mobile workforce](https://www.thenewmobileworkforce.com/on-race-day), and [Simply Chocolate](https://simplychocolate.dk) which all have their own flavor and showcase what you can do with web technology.

### [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)
Daniel Eden's GitHub repositorie has been a recent inspiration to me. It has driven my passion to see how powerful CSS can be and what can be done with it. Daniel has made a very friendly user interface to see how the animations work and test them out and on top of that made them open source to see what is going on behind the hood!

### [Project Dent](https://github.com/ProjectDent/ARKit-CoreLocation) and [Dent Reality](https://dentreality.com)
Project Dent and Dent Reality have really inspired me as of late. AR will be the next big thing on mobile devices and finding cool and interesting ways to use it will change how we use our phones and devices on a day-to-day basis. Dent Reality's project inspires me because it is something that I, myself, had in my mind for a long time but might not have had the means to implement it. Their ideas of pairing computer vision with AR is fantastic and is really what makes the app work. Another reason this project inspires me is it was a small team of 10 contributors that came up with the API/toolkit which proves that large companies do not need to push this technology but bright creative minds can!

> These may not all be technical inspirations but these are what inspire me to push my technical abilities and learn new things!

## Focus

### Learn
The most value I would gain from this internship would be to learn from the best of creative web development, Critical Mass. For a long time now I have admired the work CM has done and it's customer driven approach. During my time at Critical Mass I would like to increase my skill set but at the same time make sure I am a valuable asset to the company and giving back while I am given such a great opportunity. My focus in learning would be working with developers and leads to understand how the creative process not only starts and finishes but flows through the company. While studying the creative process CM follows I would also continue my work on understanding and 'mastering' advanced HTML, CSS, JS, and their frameworks.

### Build
If I could build anything while at Critical Mass I would continue my research on Apple's ARKit and implementing it into an application. My original ideation, when tasked with this question, was "Wouldn't it be cool to have an AR app for Travel Alberta". My half-baked idea would consist of an application/installation that would identify Calgary landmarks like the Saddledom, Calgary Tower, and other attractions, it would also showcase other landmarks around Alberta such as Mount Yamnuska, sites around Banff and Jasper, and other things like the Columbia Icefield and display interesting facts about each site to the user.
